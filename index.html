    <h2>About what I do</h2>

    <p>Myofascial release (MFR) is a slow and gentle therapy for calming the body’s nervous system and releasing fascial restrictions. A collaborative method, MFR can access a variety of issues, therefore good communication between client and therapist is key. I’m happy to answer questions.</p>

  <h1>How I got here...</h1>
  <p>While living in Grand Rapids Michigan in 2014, I became a Physical Therapy client after a hamstring injury. My PT, Rachel Davies, had been trained in the John Barnes’ Myofascial Release (MFR)  approach. My life was in transition physically and emotionally at the time. MFR was a very supportive modality and it fit in well with the mindful, body-centered psychology (Hakomi) training which I was undertaking. Rachel sensed my potential affinity for MFR work and suggested that I consider it as a career path. Although I had never even had a pleasant massage in my life, with Rachel’s encouragement and an impulse to be of service, I went to massage school in Kalamazoo Michigan and became a licensed massage therapist. I graduated in 2016, then returned to my home state of Texas. I have taken 184 hours of continuing education since that time, all in the John Barnes’ Myofascial Release method.</p>
